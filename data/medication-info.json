        "interactions": "Drug interactions, which result in an increased clearance of sex hormones, can lead to breakthrough bleeding and contraceptive failure. The mechanism of this interaction appears to be based on the hepatic enzyme-inducing properties of these drugs. Interactions may be expected during concomitant use of hydantoins, barbiturates, primidone, carbamazepine or rifampicin; interactions with oxcarbazepine, rifabutin, troglitazone, felbamate and griseofulvin are also suspected. Maximal enzyme induction is generally not seen before 2-3 weeks but may then be sustained for at least 4 weeks after cessation of drug therapy.",
        "precautions": "Pre-existing or risk of breast cancer. Prolonged immobilisation. Diabetes. Women predisposed to chloasma should avoid sun & UV exposure. Lactation. Concomitant treatment with hepatic enzyme inducers may necessitate the use of additional barrier contraception."
